# Python Sprint - DNA Sequence
## Jesse Boise - 4/05/2020

This program can be used to perform two functions, namely:
* Transform a codon sequence into it's Amino Acid SLC equivalent.
* Read the file 'DNA.txt' and mutate its contents into two other files:
  * a file called 'normalDNA.txt' that has all of its 'a' chars converted to 'A'.
  * a file called 'mutatedDNA.txt' that has all of its 'a' chars converted to 'T'.
* Take the files outputed from mutate ('normalDNA.txt' & 'mutatedDNA.txt') and run transform on them to retrieve their Amino Acid SLCs.
